# Coffee-Shop-Sales
Dashboard in Excel

The objective of this project is to analyze fictional data for three coffee shops to create a dashboard and gain insight into their performance. The data was acquired from `Free Data Sets & Dataset Samples | Maven Analytics`. https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

The dashboard allows the user to obtain the following insights: 
1. How do sales differ across locations in the city? 
2. Which category sells the most in the coffee shop? 
3. What are the top 5 products sold? 
4. What quantity of items are sold each hour? 
5. What are the top 5 coffee blends sold? 6. Based on beverage size, what is the most ordered size? 
7. What are the overall monthly sales, including the number of visitors? 
8. What are the sales and the number of visitors per day? 
9. What is the sales revenue? 
10. How many customers have visited the coffee shop? 
11. What is the average sale and number of products ordered per customer?
